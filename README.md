To build, use your Moralis.io API Key in `ApiKeys.ts.example` and rename that file to `ApiKeys.ts`

Then, run `yarn react-app:start` to start the localhost service, or `yarn react-app:build` to package the release.

This page uses the `website` branch for hosting, which only contains the output of running `yarn react-app:build` for this repo (the resulting build directory lands in `packages/react-app/build`)
